    "2. Measuring the process of interaction\n",

    "\n",
    "The model is essential for the design and implementation of adaptation.Interaction models such as Donalda Norman is also important for the design and implementation of selected aspects of user interaction that permits or dictates the user interface.Given each of the seven steps of interaction, it can be used in the structure of the user interface in terms of direct addressing any shortcomings.E.g.Step 3. The user can determine the activities of the interface by asking the (test) user with the appropriate instrument (the controller) of the activities he planned when using the interface in the evaluation and then compared to the activities planned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of that we can see that the model is useful in the design of the interface and its evaluation, the latter is crucial.Some aspects of the model have been taken into account when designing (operationalization) instruments for the evaluation of user interfaces such as UEQ and UMUX (see chapter 4. Measurement of users).Thus, in practice, it is rare for developers to use these models to evaluate the progress in the new version of the rebel interface, but to use appropriate instruments and associated structures.\n",

    "## ■ Burnshick Lentils\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brunshik lens model is a framework for understanding how people choose a user interface and make decisions in complex environments, and offers insight into the benefits and restrictions of human judgment.Wider viewing, the model of Brunsy's lens developed by psychologist Egon Brunsy is a conceptual framework for understanding human judgment and decision -making.It shows how individuals use environmental information (called 'characters', cues) to make or decide.The model is especially important in areas such as cognitive psychology and interaction between man and smart sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dilemma between two approaches to development\n",
    "1. Study of patterns of behavior according to stimuli\n",
    "2. Finding the laws of behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Egon Burnswick Spagener has argued that the right path is only Ad 1., because 2. It is not feasible or meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the term ** Burnshick's lens **, which is the relationship between the environment and the behavior of the system in this environment, was created.Burnshick has advocated to describe an individual's behavior in relation to situations and stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ecological validity\n",
    "\n",
    "An important contribution to Burnshick's lens is ecological validity, which refers to how good the sign corresponds to the actual environment.Not all signs are equally reliable, and ecological validity measures how much weight should be realistically in the process of judgment.The high ecological validity sign provides accurate information about the environmental status, while the low ecological validity sign is less reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Subjective entry of characters\n",
    "Subjective entitlement of characters refers to the meaning attributed by the individual to different signs in the formation of judgment and decision.Even if the sign has a high ecological validity, the individual may not recognize or attribute it to him or her appropriate weight, which leads to the wrong judgment.\n",
    "The discrepancy between subjective use of characters and the actual ecological validity of characters can lead to decision -making errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### judge as a random process\n",
    "The Brunshik lens model emphasizes that the judgment by its nature is random.The environment often provides incomplete or ambiguous information, so individuals make decisions based on probability and not certainty.Decisions are therefore approximations that rely on how well a person can incorporate uncertain or probability clues.\n",

    "\n",
    "Targeted planning (or targeted design) is engaged in meeting the needs and wishes of the users of the product or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main realization is that computer systems interact is basically different from everyone else (eg car driving).It is basically matching the user's expectations, which is extremely demanding.Researchers have introduced the concept of cognitive friction, which marks the gap between expected and actual behavior.\n",

    "## ■ Usability (Usability)\n",
    "\n",
    "Usability answers the question \"Can anyone use this interface?\".\n",
    "It is a purely practical usability.\n",
    "For usability, they have developed measuring instruments that we will learn as part of user measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Eight rules:\n",
    "#### 1 Strive for consistency.\n",
    "In similar situations, a consistent sequence of actions must be required: menus and screens with the help of the same terminology should be used, and consistent commands should be used at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 For frequent users to use shortcuts.\n",
    "By increasing the frequency of use, the user's wishes also increase the reduction of the number of interactions and the increase in the pace of interaction.An experienced user is very helpful with abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands and macros.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3 Offer informative feedback.\n",
    "There must be a system feedback for each action of the operator.In the case of frequent and smaller acts, the response can be modest, and in rare and major acts the response must be greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4 Form an information channel to complete.\n",
    "The sequence of actions should be organized into groups with the beginning, the middle and the end.At the conclusion of the Group of Actions, information feedback is given to the operators with achievement, a sense of relief, a signal that the plans of actions in unpredictable events and possibilities are released from their thoughts, and a sign that the path is clear for preparing for the next group of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5 Offering simple defects.\n",
    "As far as possible, plan the system so that the user cannot make a serious error.If an error occurs, the system must be able to detect an error and offer simple and understandable mechanisms to handle the defect.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6 Allow you to return to the previous phase.\n",
    "This function relieves anxiety as the user knows that errors can be undone;This encourages exploration of unknown possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7 Support Internal Supervision site.\n",
    "Experienced users strongly want to feel that they are responsible for the system and that the system responds to their actions.Design the system so that users are the initiators of actions and not those who respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8 Reduce short - term memory load.\n",
    "The restriction of human processing of information in short -term memory requires that the display of simple, multilateral displays are concentrated, frequency of window movement reduced and sufficient time to get to know the codes and sequences of actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Designers need to be aware of the elements that affect the emotional responses of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, products have to transmit positive emotions and avoid negative ones.Other important aspects include motivational, learning, creative, social and persuasive influences.One of the methods that can help withstand such aspects is, for example, the use of dynamic icons, animations and sound to help with communication that creates a sense of interactivity.\n",
