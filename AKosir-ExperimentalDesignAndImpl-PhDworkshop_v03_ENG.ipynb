    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Questionnaires can give **useless results** because the answers to the questions are not related to the real situation. There are several reasons for this:\n",
    "1. The terms in the questions or the questions themselves **are not well defined**: terms in human language can have several meanings at the same time and if they are not specified, the answers refer to different terms, objects, etc.\n",
    "2. It is not clear in the question what it refers to - no reference is given: the question can refer to the quality of the service, interface, content, etc .;\n",
    "3. Questions can be offensive or distracting to the test person\n",
    "Consequently, it is imperative that we be skeptical about the applicability of individual issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement characteristics can detect questions that **do not work**, that is, they do not give meaningful information. The point is that the measurement characteristics indicate the properties of the answers that must always be valid (eg stability in case of multiple questions, etc.) and thus good measurement characteristics are **a necessary condition for the usability of the answers**, but not a sufficient condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "1. Estimate measurement characteristics\n",
    "2. If OK, use the data, otherwise repeat user experiment\n",

    "\n",
    "Vloga za etično presojo imam naslednje elemente: \n",
    "1. _Osnovni podatki o vlogi:_ vlagatelj, naslov, področje raziskave ipd. \n",
    "2. _Uvod:_ vlagatelj poda izhodišča raziskovalnega dela, raziskovalna vprašanja, hipoteze in druge relevantne uvodne informacije; \n",
    "3. _Udeleženci:_ število in opis udeležencev, način pridobivanja udeležencev (dobrodošla je navedba vključitvenih in izključitvenih kriterijev) in njihova morebitna korist od udeležbe;   \n",
    "4. _Raziskovalni načrt:_ opis raziskovalnega načrta (npr. anketa, eksperiment, intervju, fokusna skupina itd) ter navedba odvisnih (rezultati postopka) in neodvisnih spremenljivk (kontrola eksperimenta in drugo);\n",
    "5. _Postopek:_ poleg samega zaporedja korakov vlagatelj poda še seznam instrumentov in pripomočkov (vprašalniki, senzorji ipd), opis eksperimentalnih nalog udeležencev in izdelana navodila udeležencem.\n",
    "6. _Soglasje za sodelovanje:_ dokončan pisni obrazec za formalno soglasje k sodelovanju udeležencev, opustitev pisnega soglasja, morebitni razgovor o raziskavi in umik soglasja; \n",
    "7. _Varovanje in zaupnost podatkov:_ Vlagatelj zagotovi varovanje zajetih podatkov v vseh fazah od merjenja do shranjevanja in obdelave, torej popolno anonimnost, psevdoanonimizacijo podatkov (če je potrebno zaradi nadaljnje obdelave podatkov) ali polno anonimizacijo podatkov, ter preprečitev prepoznavnosti podatkov;\n",
    "8. _Ocena morebitnih tveganj in koristi sodelovanja:_ tveganja za testne udeležence morajo biti jasno opredeljena, prav tako njihove morebitne koristi (slednje bi lahko vplivalo na izbor udeležencev in posledično na same rezultate). \n",
    "9. _Priloge:_ potrebne priloge kot je izdelano soglasje za sodelovanje itd.\n",
