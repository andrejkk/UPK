    "##### Def.: Sentiment is the user's attitude towards entities, which are individuals, organizations, products, events, topics, content and his attitude towards their properties. Therefore, the user's sentiment is tied to a specific entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such an entity is also multimedia content, its author, the service it provides (e.g. Facebook), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A user can have **different sentiments towards different entities** at **the same time**. For example, an emotional state does not have such properties - it is determined at any given moment by a single one and is therefore the user's state and is not necessarily tied to a single entity or any entity at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attitude is related to affective and emotional states and mood, to opinion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
