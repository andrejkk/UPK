    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychological constructs are of the utmost importance when measuring users outside of real time, which is carried out on the basis of a user's self -employment in the form of answers to questions.They are made up of an instrument (a list of questions by the measurement - user answers) and specific structures from one or more dimensions or.Aspects that are evaluated in numeric form based on these answers.E.g.The construct of Applicability has one dimension of \"Applicability\", which is evaluated on the basis of answers to 10 carefully selected questions.These questions are selected based on so -called operationalization and one or more experiments on real measurements, followed by a multivariate statistical analysis.The purpose of the latter is to assess or this set of questions 1. It measures what is intended for (validity) and 2. This measures stable and reliable (reliability).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we not ask the user in an instant \"Do you find this service good?\" But do we ask him a larger number of indirect questions?Simply because human natural language is not accurate enough to get stable and valid answers.Experiments have shown that when asked \"service is good\", users think of extremely different aspects, from the shape and structure of the interface to the specific features of the service itself.Therefore, the answers are very scattered and are useless to direct the concrete development of applications and services.The solution is to ask the user more better questions and then analyze the answers.Because both questions and answers are related to each other, they are summarized by dimension (multivariate statistics) at the minimum number of dimensions that then make up the construct.We add operational significance to these dimensions or rocks and consequently become readable for humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of psychological constructs in technology is exceptional.Selected set of user states and behavior Konstuct 1. Defines and 2. Makes it measurable.Such a construct is e.g.The Applicability of the system.What is the Applicability of the instrument and the construct was unknown.defined in a way that would be useful in the development of services and applications.Today, however, under the term Applicability, we understand what this construct evaluates!However, realistic measurement (measurability), of course, requires a prerequisite for any Applicability in real technological development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the written, it is understandable that making your own questionnaire for practical use is always a wrong decision.The right decision is to select an appropriate existing validated inacatrument and construct.As the experience of the construction of new instruments and structures shows, it requires extensive experiments, several times in several consecutive performances and demanding analysis in the field of multivariate statistics.The laws of his own questionnaire are doomed to fail in terms of validity (what measures) and reliability (gives stable results).\n",

    "\n",
    "Questionnaires can produce **useless results * Because the ridicule of the questions are not related to the real situation.There are more reasons for this:\n",
    "1. Concepts in questions or questions themselves **are not well defined**: terms in human language can carry several meanings at the same time and if they are not specified, the answers refer to different concepts, objects, etc\n",
    "2. The question is not clear what the reference is - the reference is not given: the questions may be related to the quality of the service, the interface, the content, etc.;\n",
    "3. Questions can be offensive or disturbing for a test person\n",
    "As a result, it is imperative that we are skeptical of individual issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement characteristics detect questions that ** do not work **, do not give meaningful answers.It is that measurement characteristics are perceived by the properties of answers that always have to apply (eg stability to multiple questions, etc.), and thus good measurement carcateristics ** is a requirement for the Applicability of answers **, but not a sufficient condition.\n",
